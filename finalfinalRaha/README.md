+ Addons used: ofxVectorGraphics, ofxExplodingString
+ political statement about donald trump, the vector graphic is placed over his open mouth and changes shape as you move the mouse, the graphic has a green, vommit-like color to express the idea that everything he says is basically just word vomit. You can also click and drag to scribble over his face and I included instructions about that on the screen.
+ if you click, his name will explode
