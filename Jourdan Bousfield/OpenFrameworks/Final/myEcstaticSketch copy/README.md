Romote Controlled Image Manipulation
=================================

oF Final
Jourdan Bousfield 2015


For my final project I combined technologies to create an interactive image manipulating program. This program allows anyone to connect their phone to the installation and manipulate the image. 

I used openframeworks to create the manipulations of the image. 

Two add ons were used to enable the connection with Spacebrew:

ofxSpacebrew

ofxLibwebsockets

By connecting to space brew I was able to connect open frameworks to the accelerometer in my phone. I then used that data to control the manipulation of the image. 

I worked with Amazons web hosting services in order to get the the application online so that the url could be accessed from my phone.

I used the Openframeworks  Creating a Mesh tutorial in order to help me with the image manipulations. 
Here is a link to my Openframeworks sketch



As I mentioned above, the two can be connected through Spacebrew.
