Birds  are the most omnipresent, most recognizable representatives of the other species that share the fate of the planet with us. However, with the advent of human activities, in terms of climate change, habitat destruction, the birds species are being threatened leading to their extinction. 

I want to create an installation using openFrameworks to show how human activities impact the existence of birds.

I have used the addOn ofxBoids to depict the movement of the birds. 

I have also used Serial and Arduino to bring about the interaction between human world and the natural world.

A proximity on the sensor reads the distance between the human and the screen. As the human gets closer, the birds start to disappear. In order to get the birds back, one can drag the mouse on the screen.
